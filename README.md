# sequence_data_download

Repository of scripts with helpful commands for downloading sequencing data from the Sequencing Read Archive (SRA).

Hopefully it will eventually include instructions for all 3 regional data repositories.

You can tell which regional data repository your reads were submitted to by looking at the first 3 letters of the accession:

| Prefix | Repository | Region | Example ID |
| ------ | ---------- | ------ | ---------- |
|  SRR   | NCBI SRA   |  USA   | SRR12345678 |
|  ERR   | ENA (EBI)  | Europe | ERR12345678 |
|  DRR   | DDBJ SRA   | Japan  | DRR12345678 |
